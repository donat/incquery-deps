% I think, here only goes text. Brief description what is the work is about. 

\section{Control systems at CERN}
What is CERN, what is it about.

Complexity of the controls systems.

Main objectives in the systems. What do we want to achieve? %Introducing nex section for smooth upgrades.

\section{Smooth upgrades}

Describe, what can be done to achieve this goal. Can be done with methods, metrics, communication and searching for incoming dependencies.
 
Detail incoming dependencies through a use-case (insert Vito's example).

Why there is no off-the-shelf solution for this software. 1) Size limitation. 2) functionality limitation 3) Usually we have to deal with open-world semantics, but in this case we know, what we are looking for.
