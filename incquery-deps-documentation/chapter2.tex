\section{Related technologies}
% Why do we need this part.
Before proceeding to the main part of this paper, I am going to give an overview
about the related technologies used by my solution. I Why do we have to present
the related technologies.

\subsection{Java Runtime}

\subsubsection{Java byte code specification}
How the java vm works.
What is the input.
What kind of information can be extracted from here.

\subsubsection{Apache Commons Byte Code Engineering Library}
% described in the virtual machine specification 
% http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se5.0/html/VMSpecTOC.doc.html 
% how the virtual machine works
% what kind of infomration is available in the bytecode 
\cite{BCEL}
Abstraction over Java byte code specification. 
How it works. Create diagram!
Possible use-cases.


\subsection{Eclipse}

\subsubsection{Eclipse Integrated Development Environment}
The Eclipse Project \cite{Eclipseproject} is an open source software development
project dedicated to providing a robust, full-featured, commercial-quality,
industry platform for the development of highly integrated tools. It was
developed by IBM from 1999, and a few months after the first version was
shipped, IBM donated the source code to the Eclipse Foundation.

The Eclipse project consists of many subprojects, the most important being the
Eclipse Platform, that defines the set of frameworks and common services that
collectively make up ,,integration-ware'' required to support a comprehensive
tool integration platform. These services and frameworks represent the common
facilities required by most tool builders, including a standard workbench user
interface and project model for managing resources, portable native widget and
user interface libraries, automatic resource delta management for incremental
compilers and builders, language-independent debug infrastructure, and
infrastructure for distributed multi-user versioned resource management.

The Eclipse Platform has an easily-extendable modular architecture, where all
functionality is achieved by plugins, running over a low-level core called
Platform Runtime. This runtime core is only responsible for loading and
connecting the available plugins, every other functionality, such as the
editors, views, project management, is handled by plugins. The plugins bundled
with Eclipse Platform include general user interface components, a common help
system for all Eclipse components, project management and team work support.

\subsubsection{Eclipse Java Development Tools}
% TODO: Write jdt description with the same details as the Eclipse platform.

\subsubsection{Eclipse Modeling Framework}
The Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) \cite{EMF} is a Java framework and code
generation facility for building tools and other applications based on a
structured model. EMF is also maintained by the Eclipse Foundation within the
scope of Eclipse Tools Project. EMF started out as an implementation of the OMG
Meta Object Facility (MOF) specification, and evolved into a highly efficient
product for model-based software design

EMF requires a metamodel as an input; it can import metamodels from different
sources, such as Rational Rose, XMI or XML Schema documents, or a special syntax
can be used to annotate existing Java source files with EMF model properties.
Once an EMF model is specified, the built-in code generator can create a
corresponding set of Java implementation classes.
These generated classes can be edited to add methods and instance variables;
additions will be preserved during code-regeneration. In addition to simply
increasing productivity, building an application using EMF provides several
other benefits like model change notification, persistence support including
default XMI and schema-based XML serialization, a framework for model
validation, and a very efficient reflective API for manipulating EMF objects
generically. Most important of all, EMF provides the foundation for
interoperability with other EMF-based tools and applications.

EMF consists of two fundamental frameworks: the core framework and EMF.Edit. The
core framework provides basic generation and runtime support to create Java
implementation classes for a model.

EMF has a built-in serialization facility, which enables the developer to save
(and load) in-stances of the model into industry-standard XMI format. EMF also
provides a notational and persistence mechanism, on top of which
model-manipulating tools can easily be constructed.


\subsubsection{EMF-IncQuery} 
Incremental model queries over emf models. Documentation site.

\subsection{Other related technologies}

\subsubsection{Spring Framework}
To develop modular, testable and configurable applications.
\subsubsection{Maven}
Build system
\subsubsection{Tycho}
Maven extension to build eclipse plugins.
\subsubsection{Oracle database}
Commercial relational database management system. Full sql support. Extensive
feature set, one of the market-leaders.
% maybe it is easy to put here something from wikipedia.


\section{Example: Service Provider Framework}
\label{sect:example}

The service provider framework is a possible use-case for the Adapter design
pattern. The implementation I am going to present derived from the book
\cite{Bloch08} Effective Java.

Overview of the pattern.
