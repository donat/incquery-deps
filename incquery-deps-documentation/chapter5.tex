\section{Example revisited}
Show how the tool solves the problem. Go through all components, show all
results one by one, what is the input and the output.
focus on the process again; show how each components work and put there the results, what would be seen.

What is happening



repository in this usecase contains only three projects binary repository filled with three jars
service
client
impl

what happens in in the bytecode analysis. The structure and textual dependencies
found.
Statistics: 3 projects, 8 classes, 2 fields, 19 methods (12 defined, 6
constructor from all non-intersface class 1 static initializer) 
The entire strucute is saved into the database.

What happens during the dependenccy processing.
Bytecode ananlysis gives back the textual representation of the dependencies.
main method  in the consumer class has a method call reference to the serviceB()
method and the but the services.newIstnaecn does not have a reference  to the
provier.newInstance class, because it is an internal class.
the processor searches for rhe reference in the database and and discovers that
there is a serviceB() method defined in one of the held producst. It is returned
to the the processor, which initiates the save of the dependencies.

Storage engine.
Mention oracle db Same data in tables.
EMF database. The database contains the structure and contains the dependencies
directly. It can be traversed and navigated.

Source model synchronizer.
View of the service deveoper. as he opens the project the following emf model is
built from the state of eclipse.
\pic{wsmodel.png}{Workspace model containing Service package from the example}.
\autoref{fig:wsmodel.png} shows a readable view of the extracted model. It has
both contains all the packages classes, etc. And all internal references
\emph{including} the internal dependencies.

Workspace model synchronizer.
For the service project the entire workspace is loaded. 

Direct queries
Picture how it was queried.
Picture: result of a direct query for a field and for the method.


Model queries.
Result of the emf query.
Show the view as i

\section{Performance evaluation}
Pure measurement. What can we measure:
the size of the database.
Speed of dependency discovery.
Size size of the compacted model. 
Memory size
