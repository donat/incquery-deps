I created a tool.
It can be useful for a library developer wqorking at large, software-oriented
organization where lots of inter-depending software are developed and
maintained.
Becomes extremely useful when the concept of smooth upgrades is essential.

Implemented a precise, source-based  query solution along with a not entirely
precise but fast and reactive display of dependency data.

As for the future there are plenty of directions to go:
Slicing the repository model to load just the required part of it.
Notification about the repository change.
Define and extract more detailed dependencies from the binaries.
Extend the dependency resolution to c++ software.
